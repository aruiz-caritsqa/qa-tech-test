Looking pretty empty ğŸ˜“

- implemented the e2e test suite separately to main application
  - this way if it was decided to change the test suite at a later date, dependancies are not intertwined with the main appliaction

E2E test:
- navigate to src/test/e2e 
- run "npm install"
- run "npm test"

multi-tool-package test:
- navigate to src/test/multi-tool-package
- run "npm install"
- run "npm test"
